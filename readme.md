# GitHub Organization

I've created a [GitHub organization](https://github.com/orgs/CDSeattleMEAN052017) for this class.  Please create a repository in that organization with your name (so my repo is `jack_brounstein`) by clicking the green "New" button in the right-hand sidebar.  Each day, some assignments will be marked with **GitHub**; in addition to uploading those files to the platform, please also push them into your GitHub repo.  The hope is that this will help you become more familiar with using version control as well as make it convenient for me to check your progress at a glance.

Don't remember how to push things to GitHub?  Look up these commands:

* `git init`
* `git add .`
* `git commit -m "some message"`
* `git push`

Don't have access to the organization?  Send me your GitHub username on Slack.

### Wednesday, May 10

Advanced JavaScript: Callbacks, closures, immediate functions

We are mostly skipping the Node.js chapter--it explains in great detail how to run a web server with only Node, but for the rest of the course, we'll be using Express, which does the same thing but with much more convenient syntax.  However, make sure you read the "Node Modules" tab and complete the "Math Module" assignment.

Assignments|
---|
JavaScript Library|
Button Fun|
Math Module **GitHub**|

Optional|
---|
Hunting GitHub|
DojoQuery|
Fib + Nacci|
Game Ideas|


### Thursday, May 11

Express: Building a web server in JavaScript

We'll also be skipping the socket.io portion.  Sockets are really cool, but they're not covered on the belt exam, and I'd rather give you an extra day to practice full MEAN.  We'll talk about socket.io during project week.

Assignments|
---|
Survey Form **GitHub**|


### Friday, May 12

Oh no, Mongo!

Message board will probably take a chunk of your weekend.  Don't fret that it's taking too long--it's a large assignment, and it's important to do right.

Assignments|
---|
Intro to MongoDB|
Mongoose Dashboard|
Quoting Dojo Redux **GitHub**|
Message Board **GitHub**|

## Week 2

### Monday, May 15

Modularization: Turning one giant server file into several smaller files

We'll also talk about using `express-session` to handle login/registration

1955 API might not seem like much, but it's actually a very important assignment.  If you can complete it, you'll have pretty much all you need on the server side for a MEAN app...which is good, because tomorrow we start dealing with the client side.

Assignments|
---|
Modularized Mongoose|
1955 API **GitHub**|

### Tuesday, May 16

Angular 4!  ES2016, TypeScript, Components, and Event Listeners.

Read TypeScript, Component - Data, and Component - Events

For all of these assignments, try to replicate the functionality using only one component.  (We'll discuss multiple, possibly nested, components tomorrow)

Assignments|
---|
My first Angular App|
Components in Components|
Components and Pipes **GitHub**|

Optional|
---|
Javascript & TypeScript Basic|

### Wednesday, May 17

Nested components, inputs and output

Read Architecture & Nested Components

For these assignments, recreate the functionality, but don't use a service.  (Services will be covered tomorrow.)  For AlwaysNote, remember to use `@Input` and `@Output`!

Assignments|
---|
Task and Inputs **GitHub**|
Users|
User Validations **GitHub**|
AlwaysNote **GitHub**|

### Thursday, May 18

Angular routes and services

Read Routing & Observables and Services, Promises, & HTTP.  Note that we'll be using the HTTP module tomorrow to make requests to our server once we have a full MEAN app.

Assignments|
---|
Routing|
Routes and Subroutes|


### Friday, May 19

Angular review + full MEAN!

When running a full MEAN application, we'll replace `ng serve` with `ng build -w` (and `nodemon server.js`, of course!)

Five assignments may look like a lot, but the first four are all building individual pieces that are combined into MEAN Friends.

Assignments|
---|
File Structure and Simple Server|
Friends API|
Angular Friends|
Building Factories and Controllers|
MEAN Friends **GitHub**|
